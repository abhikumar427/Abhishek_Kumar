CS 579 Assignment 4

In this assignment, I've used TwitterAPI to collect twitter users and tweets for clustering and sentiment analysis. There are four python scripts, collect.py, cluster.py, classify.py and summarize.py. 

I've collected 100 tweets for sundarpichai in collect.py

cluster.py is to divide the initial four users and their friends into different communities. I've used Girvan_Newman algorithm with betweenness of each edge, but I also got 3 single users as one clusters. These users are considered as outliers and we only consider clusters with more than one user.

classify.py use afinn method to classify the sentiment of each tweet. Tweets with positive scores are classified as positive tweets, negative scores as negative tweets and zero score as neutral tweets.

summarize.py writes the output into summary.txt.

Conclusions:

I wanted to know Sundar Pichai who's the CEO of Google follows people outside his style of work. I was amazed to see some of the people were Steph Curry, Virat Kohli who's an Indian Cricketer and Kevin Durant. He's a sport follower.
I've collected just 100 tweets but I've got a descent intuition into how people react to google products lately.

For sentiment analysis the 100 tweets are clustered into three instances using AFINN method - Positive with positive scores, negative with negative scores and neutral with zero scores. I see more of neutral and positive tweets for sundar pichai more than negative. So he's doing good in the industry right now. Afinn is a very basic approach for sentiment analysis but this simple approach giving good results made me understand I should even try Machine Learning methods, training set and test data to improve data analysis.
